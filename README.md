# FIFA

## Intro

If there's been one constant in my life, it would be soccer. I not only have fond memories in the form of playing under the floodlights in the rain and cold or waking up at 4 am to watch overseas games with my dad, but also from playing the game virtually on none other than EA Sports' FIFA. I remember at a young age always playing as Argentina in FIFA 2000 scoring goals with Batistuta, and re-inserting the disk multiple times just to watch [the amazing intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64h4pztcpqE) over and over. From then on I collected every edition, and whether it was playing all night at my friend's house or years later playing in dorm room tournaments in university, my fascination for the game never faded. As I develop my skills in the world of data analytics, I figured that there's no better way to improve than to use what I've learned to run analysis on soccer. In this particular project I wanted to focus on one of my favourite editions of FIFA, FIFA19.
